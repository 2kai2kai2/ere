# Roadmap

## Features

-   [ ] POSIX-compilant ambiguous submatching rules: we currently implement the Perl-like greedy submatching when submatches are ambiguous (this should only affect `exec`, not `test`, and only more complex regexes). While known implementations are more expensive, I plan on also supporting the POSIX rules.
-   [ ] Case-insensitive mode: while regexes can be modified to support case-insensitivity (and this can also be done on ascii by just lower-casing the text first), I intend to implement case-insensitive mode.
-   [ ] Non-capturing groups: `(?:non-capturing)` while not POSIX ERE standard-compilant, this is a relatively commonly used feature (and can improve performance by not tracking matches). If added, this will be behind a feature flag.

## Performance Improvements

-   [x] `u8`-based engines: performance improvements can be made for many regexes (such as those with only ascii) by using `u8`s instead of extracting variably one to four-byte `char`s from strings.
-   [ ] Additional limited-feature engines. This is relatively open-ended, but major improvements can be made for regexes with certain properties.
    -   [x] One-pass engine: performance improvements can be made for 'one-pass' regexes where there is never more than one path to take when consuming the next symbol.
